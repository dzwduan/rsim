<P>
RSIM provides compile-time options to enable copious debugging and
diagnostic output to be printed to the standard output and to separate
files. Such tracing information is likely to be very important to
anyone seeking to modify RSIM. There are various compile time flags
which the user can selectively turn on to get debugging information
for one section of the system (e.g., the network interfaces, the first
level cache), but it is often the case that the user will want all
debugging flags available turned on together, as in the debugging
makefiles provided with the RSIM distribution.
<P>
The processor debugging output is written into files called <I>
corefile</I>s. Each processor has its own corefile, and the
suffix of each file represents the processor number (with a 
<TT>corefile.<EM>i</EM></TT> file for each processor with processor number <EM>i</EM>.)
These files
contain detailed information on each stage of  simulation for every instruction.
<P>
The debugging output related to the memory hierarchy and network is
printed on the simulation output file. This debugging information is
also very detailed, providing information about nearly all relevant
activity in the cache hierarchy, the directory, the busses, and the
network interfaces.
<P>
Because of the amount of information provided by these debugging
options, these files can quickly grow into several megabytes of data
in just thousands of processor cycles. The ``-t'' and ``-c'' options
described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#cmd_line">4</A> can be used to limit this tracing
to the exact spot where the problem is suspected. In the case of
deadlocks, this moment of simulation time can be determined to some
extent through the use of the periodic partial statistics displayed by
RSIM, as processors will usually stop graduating instructions soon
after the deadlock ensues.
