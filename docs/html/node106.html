<P>

<P>
The function <TT>L2ProcessTagReq</TT> is called for accesses that have
reached the head of an L2 tag array pipeline. <TT>L2ProcessTagReq</TT> is
largely similar to <TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> but has some key
differences, described below.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 1: Presence of a data array</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The first difference between <TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> and <TT>L2ProcessTagReq</TT> deals with the data array. <TT>
REQUEST</TT>s that hit, the data response for <TT>REPLY</TT>s, as well as the
copyback portions of <TT>COHE</TT> messages and write-backs (whether
replacements at the L2 or unsolicited fills from the L1) all require
data array accesses.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 2: Servicing <TT>COHE</TT> messages</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For <TT>COHE</TT> messages, the L2 cache marks the line in question with
a ``pending-coherence'' bit and then forwards possible actions to the
L1 cache first.
<P>
The actual actions for the message are processed at
the time of the <TT>COHE_REPLY</TT>; however, <TT>NACK_PEND</TT> responses
from the L1 cache are forwarded to the directory immediately for
non-<TT>WRB</TT> messages. The pending-coherence bit is also cleared
upon receiving the <TT>COHE_REPLY</TT>.
<P>
Additionally, the L2 cache is responsible for
resolving cache-to-cache transfer requests.  On a successful
cache-to-cache transfer, the L2 cache not only sends a <TT>
COHE_REPLY</TT> acknowledgment or copyback to the directory, but also
sends a <TT>REPLY</TT> to the requesting processor with the desired
data. The cache-to-cache transfer policy follows that depicted in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node27.html#coherencepic">3.3</A>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 3: Additional conditions for stalling <TT>REQUEST</TT> messages</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> function adds two further conditions for
stalling <TT>REQUEST</TT> messages in the case of the L2 cache.
<P>
<TT>REQUEST</TT>s that hit a line with its pending-coherence bit set
receive a return value of <TT>NOMSHR_STALL_COHE</TT> from <TT>
notpres_mshr</TT>. This indicates that no MSHR has been consumed, but
that this <TT>REQUEST</TT> must wait for the pending <TT>COHE</TT>
first. This case does not appear in the L1 cache because that cache
does not have pending-coherence bits for lines.
<P>
If the <TT>REQUEST</TT> is not able to reserve a space in the write-back
buffer for its expected <TT>REPLY</TT>, the <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> function
returns <TT>NOMSHR_STALL_WRBBUF_FULL</TT>. This indicates to the
function <TT>L2ProcessTagReq</TT> that no MSHR will be allocated for this
<TT>REQUEST</TT> until space in the write-back buffer becomes available.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 4: Handling retries</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The L2 cache accepts <TT>REPLY</TT>s from the directory with the <TT>s.reply</TT>
field set to <TT>RAR</TT> (request a retry). This indicates that the directory
could not process the <TT>REQUEST</TT> and is returning it to avoid
deadlock. In this case, the cache must reissue the original <TT>REQUEST</TT>.
The cache uses the MSHR originally allocated by the <TT>REQUEST</TT> as
a resource from which to reissue the <TT>REQUEST</TT>, thus allowing the
retry message to be accepted even if the outbound <TT>REQUEST</TT> port
is blocked.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 5: Handling replacements caused by replies</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The most significant differences between <TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> and <TT>L2ProcessTagReq</TT> deal with the handling of
replacements. The L2 cache has a write-back buffer for victimization
messages to the directory.
Before a <TT>REQUEST</TT> can be sent out,
the <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> function must ensure that there will be a
write-back buffer space available for the reply.
<P>
When the <TT>REPLY</TT>
returns to the cache, a write-back buffer is tentatively booked.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 5a: Replies that replace no line or a shared line</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
If the <TT>REPLY</TT> causes no replacement, the write-back buffer space is
freed. If the <TT>REPLY</TT> replaces a shared line, the cache sends
a subset enforcement invalidation to the L1 cache, possibly using the
write-back buffer entry as a resource from which to send the invalidation.
This resource is added to the smart MSHR list simulator abstraction.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Difference 5b: Replies that replace an exclusive line</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
However, if the <TT>REPLY</TT> causes a replacement of
an exclusive line, the write-back buffer space may actually be used for
data as well.
<P>
If the L1
cache above is write-through, an invalidation message is sent up
to the L1 cache. If it cannot be sent immediately, the cache
uses the write-back buffer entry as a resource from
which to send the message. After the invalidation message is
sent up, the write-back or replacement message tries to
issue from the write-back buffer entry to the port below it.
Again, if this message cannot be sent immediately, the write-back
buffer entry will be used as a resource to hold the message until
it can be sent. In both cases, the write-back buffer entry
is added to the smart MSHR list simulator abstraction.
<P>
If the L1 cache is write-back, the <TT>WRB</TT>
first passes through the L2 data array if the line in L2
is held in dirty state, then to the L1 cache as a subset-enforcement <TT>COHE</TT>
message.
The next <TT>WRB</TT> coherence reply from the L1 is used to
either replace the data currently held for the line in the write-back
buffer (on a positive acknowledgment) or to inform the cache that the
L1 cache did not have the desired data (on a <TT>NACK</TT>).  A variety
of races are handled in these cases, as the L1 may send an
unsolicited write-back at nearly the same time as the L2 sends a
request for a write-back. The details of these races are explained
in the inline documentation with the code.
<P>
If neither the L2 nor the L1 had the line in
dirty state, a <TT>REPL</TT> message, rather than a <TT>WRB</TT> is sent to
the directory.  The directory-bound write-back or replacement message uses
its write-back buffer entry as a resource from which to send the
message to insure that an inability to
send out a <TT>WRB</TT> does not stall the <TT>REPLY</TT> that
caused the replacement or the <TT>COHE_REPLY</TT> from the subset-enforcement
<TT>WRB</TT>. Once the write-back or replacement message issues to
the port below it, its space in the write-back buffer is cleared.
