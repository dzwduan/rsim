<P>
As discussed in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#rpipes_except">3.2.4</A>, RSIM's trap convention
differs from that of Solaris, so libraries that include Solaris system
traps cannot be directly used with an application.  Thus, RSIM is distributed with the
RSIM Applications Library, which provides some of the library
functions needed for linking the applications to be simulated.
The RSIM Applications Library includes code derived from the
GNU C Library and is distributed under the terms of the GNU Library
General Public
License, described at <TT>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html</TT>.
<P>
The RSIM applications library includes the UNIX I/O functions (<TT>close</TT>, <TT>
dup</TT>, <TT>dup2</TT>, <TT>lseek</TT>, <TT>open</TT>, <TT>read</TT>, and <TT>
write</TT>), the <TT>stdio</TT> library (e.g. <TT>printf</TT>, <TT>fscanf</TT>,
<TT>fopen</TT>), the <TT>sbrk</TT> memory allocation system trap, system
traps associated with timing (<TT>time</TT> and <TT>times</TT>), the <TT>
exit</TT> function, the <TT>atexit</TT> function, and the <TT>getopt</TT>
function. The semantics of these functions are almost always identical
to those on an ordinary UNIX system; however, in the case of an error,
these functions will not set the <TT>errno</TT> variable (set by many of
the standard UNIX functions).
<P>
Additionally, the RSIM applications library provides important multiprocessor
primitives for process management, memory allocation, memory mapping,
and synchronization. (The synchronization primitives are described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#apps_syncsupport">5.3</A>.) Other functions, such as the math
library, the string library, the standard memory-allocation functions
(<TT>malloc</TT>, <TT>free</TT>, <TT>calloc</TT>, etc.), and random-number
generators can be linked from the ordinary system libraries.
<P>
Besides the above system traps used for supporting UNIX functions,  a few
additional system traps are provided with RSIM to enable ease of
programming. The call <TT>getpid()</TT> returns the processor number
of the calling process. The trap <TT>sys_bzero(void *addr, int
sz)</TT> performs a fast, non-simulated clearing of a region of memory. This
trap can be useful for speeding up initialization in some applications.
<P>
As described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#memmodel">5.1</A>, new processes are generated in
RSIM using the <TT>fork()</TT> call, which
spawns off a new process on a separate processor.
RSIM also provides a new library
function called <TT>atfork()</TT> which provides a set of optional
cleanup functions to be called by the parent process before executing a
<TT>fork()</TT>, just as the standard UNIX function <TT>atexit()</TT> does for
the <TT>exit()</TT> call.
<P>
Shared memory can only be allocated through the use of the function
<TT>void *shmalloc(int size)</TT>. This function returns a pointer to a
region of shared memory with a size of <TT>size</TT>, just as <TT>
malloc</TT> does for the private heap. Currently, this function returns
regions starting at a cache-line boundary.
<P>
<TT>AssociateAddrNode(void *start, void *end, int proc, char
*name)</TT> assigns <TT>proc</TT> as the home node for the memory range from
<TT>start</TT> (inclusive) to <TT>end</TT> (exclusive). This assignment
can be done at the granularity of a cache line. This function is an
optional performance-tuning technique for applications; if a cache
line being accessed is not associated, it will be associated using a
first-touch policy on a cache-line granularity.  
The <TT>name</TT> argument is required and can be
used internally for debugging, but currently has no externally visible
role.
<P>
<TT>abort(int code)</TT> forces all processors to stop immediately; this
differs from <TT>exit(int code)</TT> in that <TT>exit</TT> only terminates
the calling process. Further, <TT>exit</TT> calls the cleanup functions
provided through the <TT>atexit</TT> library functions, whereas <TT>abort</TT>
does not.
<P>
<TT>GET_L2CACHELINE_SIZE()</TT> returns the cache-line size of the
secondary cache, which is the system's coherence granularity. This can
be useful for padding out array accesses to avoid false-sharing.
<P>
Some system traps support timing functions. <TT>time</TT> and <TT>times</TT>
report the simulated time of the application execution and have nearly
the same semantics as in Unix, although <TT>time</TT> starts the clock at
the beginning of simulation rather than the beginning of 1970.  <TT>
sysclocks()</TT> gives a more detailed measurement, actually returning the
number of simulated processor clock cycles since the start of the
simulation.
<P>
Currently, some UNIX system traps are not supported with RSIM at all;
consequently, functions based on these traps (such as <TT>strftime</TT>
and <TT>signal</TT>) are not supported. Additionally, self-modifying
code is not supported.
