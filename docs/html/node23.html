<H2><A NAME="SECTION02221000000000000000">Pipeline stage details</A></H2>
<P>
The <B>instruction fetch stage</B> reads instructions from the
predecoded input file.  RSIM currently does not model an instruction
cache.  The maximum number of instructions brought into the processor
per cycle is a configurable parameter.
<P>
The <B>instruction decode stage</B> handles register renaming and inserts
the decoded instruction into the active list.
The key data
structures used in this stage are the register map table, the
free list, the active list, and the shadow mappers. These data
strucutres closely follow the
corresponding microarchitectural features of the MIPS R10000. The RSIM
processor follows the MIPS R10000 convention for maintaining registers,
in which both architectural register state and speculative register state
are kept in a unified physical register file&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#MIPSR10KMICRO">28</A>].
The register map
table keeps track of the logical to physical register mapping, and the
free list indicates the physical registers available for use.  
A
logical register is mapped to a new physical register whenever the
logical register is the destination of an instruction being
decoded. 
The new physical register (taken from the free list) is marked <EM>busy</EM> until the
instruction completes. The previous value of the logical register
remains in the physical register to which it was formerly
mapped. This physical register is not returned to the free list until the
instruction with the new mapping has graduated. Integer and floating point registers are mapped independently.
Currently, RSIM assumes that the processor will always have
sufficient renaming registers for its specified active list 
size<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#445"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
An instruction is entered into the active list when it is
decoded, and it remains in the active list until it graduates.
This stage also dispatches memory instructions to the memory
unit, which is used to insure that memory operations occur in the
appropriate order, as detailed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#rpipes_mem">3.2.3</A><A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#446"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
The size of the active list and memory unit are configurable.
<P>
For
branch instructions, the decode stage allocates a shadow mapper
to allow a fast recovery on a misprediction, as discussed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node24.html#rpipes_branch">3.2.2</A>.  The prediction of a branch
as taken stops the RSIM processor from decoding any further
instructions in this cycle,
as many current processors do
not allow the instruction fetch or decode stage to access two
different regions of the instruction address space
in the same
cycle. The number of shadow mappers is configurable.
<P>
The <B>instruction issue stage</B> issues ready instructions.
For an instruction to issue, it must have no outstanding data dependences or
structural hazards. With one exception, the only register data dependences
that affect the issue of an instruction in RSIM are RAW
(true) dependences; other register dependences are eliminated by register
renaming<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#447"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.  RAW
dependences are detected by observing the ``busy bit'' of a physical
register in the register file.
<P>
Structural hazards in the issue stage relate
to the availability of functional units. There are 3 basic types of
functional units supported in RSIM: ALU (arithmetic/logical unit), FPU
(floating point unit), and ADDR (address generation unit). If no
functional unit is available, the processor simulator notes a
structural dependence and refrains from issuing the instruction.
The number of each type of functional unit is configurable.
A memory instruction issues to the cache only if a cache port is available
and if the address of the instruction has already been generated.
Additional constraints for memory issue are described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#rpipes_mem">3.2.3</A>.
<P>
The <B>instruction execute stage</B> calculates the results of
the instruction as it would be generated by its functional unit.
These results include the addresses of loads and stores at the address
generation unit.
The latencies and repeat rates of the ALU and FPU instructions for this
stage are configurable.
<P>
The <B>instruction complete stage</B> stores the computed results
of an instruction into its physical
register. This stage also clears that physical register's busy bit
in the register file, thus indicating to the issue stage that
instructions stalled for data dependences on this register may
progress. This stage does not affect memory store operations, which
have no destination register.
<P>
The completion stage also resolves the proper outcome of predicted
branches. If a misprediction is detected, later instructions in the 
active list are flushed and the processor program counter is set to the proper
target of the branch. The shadow mapper for a branch is freed
in this stage.
<P>
The <B>instruction graduate stage</B> ensures that the instructions
graduate and commit their values into architectural state in-order,
thereby allowing the processor to maintain precise exceptions.
When an instruction is graduated, the processor frees the physical
register formerly associated with its destination register (before
this instruction was decoded). With the exception of stores, the
graduation of an instruction marks the end of its life in the system;
stores are discussed separately in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#rpipes_mem">3.2.3</A>.
After graduation, the instruction leaves
the active list. The number of instructions that can graduate in
a single cycle is configurable.
<P>
The RSIM processor also detects exceptions at the point of
graduation. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#rpipes_except">3.2.4</A> describes how
the processor simulator handles exceptions.
