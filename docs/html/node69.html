The remainder of this manual describes the implementation of RSIM.
It is intended for users interested in modifying
RSIM, and assumes an  understanding of Part&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#usersguide">i</A>
of this manual.
<P>
RSIM is organized as a discrete-event-driven simulator. The
central data structure of such a simulator is an event list
consisting of events that are scheduled for the future in simulation time.
Typically, an event for a hardware module is scheduled for a given
time only when it is known that the module will need to perform some
action at that time. Thus, discrete-event-driven simulators typically
do not perform an action for every cycle. In RSIM, however, the processors and
cache hierarchies are modeled as a single event (called <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT>),
which is scheduled every cycle. This is because we expect that some
activity will be required of the processor and caches every cycle.
Note that RSIM is not a pure cycle-by-cycle simulator since events for
the busses, directories, and network models are scheduled only when needed.
<P>
RSIM is implemented in a modular fashion for ease of development and
maintenance. The primary subsystems in RSIM are the event-driven
simulation library, the processor out-of-order execution engine,
the processor memory unit, the cache hierarchy, the 
directory module, and the interconnection
system. These modules perform the following roles:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Event-driven simulation library</STRONG>
<DD> Steers the course of the
simulation, activating the processors, memory hierarchy, and network
subsystem according to the demands of the simulated application and 
system. This subsystem is based on the YACSIM event-driven
simulation library&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#CovingtonDwarkadas1991">3</A>, <A HREF="node132.html#YACSIM">8</A>].
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Processor out-of-order execution engine</STRONG>
<DD> Maintains the processor
pipelines described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node22.html#rpipes_up">3.2</A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Processor memory unit</STRONG>
<DD> Interfaces
the processor pipelines with the caches, maintaining the various
ordering constraints described in 
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#rpipes_mem">3.2.3</A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Cache hierarchy</STRONG>
<DD> Processes requests to
the caches, including both demands from the processor and demands
from external sources. A significant part of this subsystem is
based on code from the RPPT (Rice Parallel Processing Testbed)
direct-execution simulator.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Directory and memory module</STRONG>
<DD> Processes
requests from various sources, maintaining
the cache-coherence protocol of the system. This module is also
based on code from RPPT.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Interconnection system</STRONG>
<DD> Connects the various modules within each 
node, and the nodes within the multiprocessor system. The multiprocessor
interconnection network is based on the NETSIM simulation
environment&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#NETSIM">7</A>].
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Each of the above subsystems
acts as a largely independent block, interacting with the other
units through a small number of predefined mechanisms. Thus, we expect
most modifications to RSIM to be quite focussed, and affecting
only the desired functionality. Our experience
with RSIM in a classroom setting has
borne these expectations out to some extent; however, each type of
simulator change does require detailed knowledge of the subsytem being
modified.
<P>
The remaining chapters in this part of the manual describe the above
subsystems in detail and provide other additional information needed
to understand the implementation of RSIM. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#rsim_event">8</A>
gives a brief explanation of the event-driven simulation library underlying
RSIM and the manner in which RSIM uses it. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node74.html#rsim_init">9</A>
describes the initialization routines in RSIM. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node75.html#rsimproc_ooo">10</A>
gives an overview of <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> and describes the details of each stage in the processor out-of-order
execution engine. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#rsimproc_memunit">11</A> explains the
implementation of the processor memory unit.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node90.html#rsimmemsys_over">12</A> describes fundamental data
structures used for the cache, memory, and network systems.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node99.html#rsimmemsys_cache">13</A> explains the key functions within the
simulation of the cache hierarchy. 
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node112.html#rsimmemsys_dir">14</A> 
describes the implementation of the directory module. 
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node121.html#rsimmemsys_interconnect">15</A> explains the principles of the
interconnection system simulated in RSIM. 
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node126.html#rsim_aux">16</A>
explains the additional support provided by RSIM for statistics and
debugging. Finally, Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node129.html#predecodeunelf">17</A> describes
the RSIM predecoder and the <TT>unelf</TT> utility.
