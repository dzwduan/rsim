When the processor is first set into
exception mode by the graduation functions, it stops decoding new
instructions and instead calls the function <TT>PreExceptionHandler</TT>
each cycle. This function makes sure that all stores in the memory
unit prior to the excepting instruction have issued to the caches
before allowing any
exception to trap to the kernel. This step is important if a kernel
trap can eventually result in context termination or paging, as the
pages needed for the store to take place may no longer be present in
the system after such an exception.  Soft exceptions (described
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#rpipes_except">3.2.4</A>) may be processed
immediately, as these are resolved entirely in hardware.
<P>
After the above conditions have completed, <TT>PreExceptionHandler</TT>
calls <TT>ExceptionHandler</TT>, which starts by flushing the branch queue,
the memory unit, the processor stall queue, and the active list, just
as in the case of a branch misprediction. Although a real processor would
also need to reverse process the register mappings in order to obtain
the correct register mapping for continuing execution, the RSIM processor
uses its abstraction of logical register files to reload the physical
register file and restart with a clean mapping table.
<P>
<TT>ExceptionHandler</TT> then processes exceptions based on the exception
type.
<P>
<TT>ExceptionHandler</TT> handles soft-exceptions with the bare minimum
amount of processing for an exception. Specifically, the processor
PC and NPC are reset, and normal instruction processing occurs
as before starting with the instruction in question.
<P>
In the case of segmentation faults, the processor must determine
whether this is a fault that simply indicates the need for growing
the stack or an actual error. If the address is in a region that would
be considered appropriate for the processor stack, the function <TT>
StackTrapHandle</TT> is called. This function allocates space for the
stack increase and adds those pages to the processor <TT>
PageTable</TT>. For other types of segmentation faults, the function <TT>
FatalException</TT> is called to print information about the type of
violation and force all processors in the simulation to a halt.
<P>
In the case of an alignment error, this handler first checks to see if
the alignment used is actually acceptable according to the ISA (this
can arise as double-precision and quadruple-precision floating point
loads and stores must only be aligned to single-word boundaries in the
SPARC architecture). In such cases, the simulator must seek to emulate
the effect of these instructions and then continue. As we expect these
occurrences to be rare, RSIM currently does not simulate cache
behavior for these accesses, instead calling the corresponding
functions in <TT>src/Processor/funcs.cc</TT> immediately. In cases of
genuine alignment failures, the exception is considered
nonrecoverable, and <TT>FatalException</TT> is called.
<P>
The function <TT>SysTrapHandle</TT> handles the emulation of all
supported system traps, which include
some functions with
UNIX-like semantics (<TT>close</TT>, <TT>dup</TT>, <TT>dup2</TT>, <TT>exit</TT>,
<TT>lseek</TT>, <TT>open</TT>, <TT>read</TT>, <TT>sbrk</TT>, <TT>time</TT>, <TT>
times</TT>, and <TT>write</TT>), and some additional traps
provided
by RSIM (corresponding to the following functions and macros: <TT>abort</TT>, <TT>AssociateAddrNode</TT>, <TT>endphase</TT>, <TT>fork</TT>,
<TT>GET_L2CACHELINE_SIZE</TT>, <TT>getpid</TT>,
<TT>MEMSYS_OFF</TT>, <TT>MEMSYS_ON</TT>,
<TT>newphase</TT>, <TT>shmalloc</TT>, <TT>StatClearAll</TT>, <TT>StatReportAll</TT>,
<TT>sys_bzero</TT>, and <TT>sysclocks</TT>).
The UNIX I/O functions are emulated
by actually calling the corresponding functions in the simulator
and setting the <TT>%o0</TT> register value of the simulated processor to
indicate the return value. Note that these accesses are processed by
the host filesystem: as a result, simulated programs can actually
overwrite system files. The <TT>sbrk</TT> function is processed by
adding pages to the address space for the simulated processor.
The <TT>time</TT> and <TT>times</TT> functions use the simulated cycle time
to set the appropriate return values and structure fields.
Although all of these functions have the same
behavior as UNIX functions on success (except as noted in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node48.html#apps_library">5.2</A>) and return the same values on
failure, these functions do not set the <TT>errno</TT> variable on
failure. The additional functions provided by RSIM are handled through 
calls to simulator internal functions, setting the
<TT>%o0</TT> register value to the result of the trap.
<P>
RSIM also uses exceptions
to implement certain instructions that either modify system-wide
status registers (e.g. <TT>LDFSR</TT>, <TT>STFSR</TT>), are outdated
instructions with data-paths too complex for a processor with the
aggressive features simulated in RSIM (e.g. <TT>MULScc</TT>), or
deal with traps and must have their effects observed in a
serial, non-speculative manner (e.g. <TT>SAVED</TT> and <TT>RESTORED</TT>, which are invoked just before the end
of a window trap to indicate that the processor can modify its <TT>
CANRESTORE</TT> and <TT>CANSAVE</TT> fields; and <TT>DONE</TT> and <TT>RETRY</TT>,
which are used to return from a trap back to regular
processing&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>]).
All of these instructions types are marked with <TT>SERIALIZE</TT> traps,
and are handled in <TT>
ProcessSerializedInstructions</TT>.  In the case of <TT>STFSR</TT> and <TT>
STXFSR</TT>, control will be transfered to instructions in the trap-table,
while <TT>DONE</TT> and <TT>RETRY</TT> transfer control back to the <TT>
trappc</TT> and <TT>trapnpc</TT> fields saved aside before entering the
trap-table. Other serialized instructions continue with normal
execution starting from the instruction after the serialized one.
<P>
Window traps dispatch control to the trap table through the <TT>TrapTableHandle</TT> function. This function puts the processor into privileged state and
saves aside the PC and NPC of the faulting instruction as <TT>trappc</TT>
and <TT>trapnpc</TT>. The processor PC and NPC are then set to the
appropriate instruction sequences for the window traps, and
the processor restarts execution from within those trap-handlers.
<P>
For the remaining non-recoverable exceptions (division by zero,
floating point error, illegal instruction, priviliged instruction,
illegal program counter value), the function <TT>FatalException</TT> is
called.
