<TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> simulates the processors and cache hierarchies of
the simulated system.  It is scheduled every cycle as described in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node69.html#intover">7</A>. On every invocation, <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> loops
through all the processors and caches in the system, calling the
functions described in this section.
<P>
Note that  <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> should seek to process messages from
other portions of the system without any unexpected or unnecessary
delays. Suppose, for example, that the bus unit provided a reply to the
L2 cache at time <I>X</I>. However, if the <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> planned
for time <I>X</I> had already occurred, the <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> function
would not be able to pick up the reply until time <I>X</I>+1. On the other
hand, if the  <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> function had not already been processed for the
cycle, <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> would pick up the reply at time <I>X</I>. Thus,
the timing behavior of the would be non-deterministic and could include
unexpected delays.
To avoid this sort of problem, <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> is actually scheduled
to occur at an offset of 0.5 cycles from the processor cycle. 
<TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> starts by
completing operations that finished during the previous cycle, and then
initiates new operations based on the current cycle.
<P>
For each processor, <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> first calls <TT>L1CacheOutSim</TT>
and <TT>L2CacheOutSim</TT> (described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node99.html#rsimmemsys_cache">13</A>),
which are used to process cache accesses. Then, <TT>CompleteMemQueue</TT>
is called to inform the memory unit of any operations that have
completed at the caches. <TT>CompleteQueues</TT> is used
to process other instructions that have completed at their functional
units.
<P>
Then, <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> calls <TT>maindecode</TT>. This function starts
out by using <TT>update_cycle</TT> to update the register file and handle
other issues involved with the completion stage of the pipeline. Next,
<TT>graduate_cycle</TT> is called to remove previously completed
instructions in-order from the active list and to commit their architectural
state. Then, <TT>maindecode</TT> calls <TT>decode_cycle</TT> to bring new
instructions into the active list. After this, <TT>maindecode</TT>
returns control to <TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT>.
<P>
<TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> then calls <TT>IssueQueues</TT>, which sends ready
instructions to their functional units. After this, the functions <TT>
L1CacheInSim</TT> and <TT>L2CacheInSim</TT> are called for the caches to
bring in new operations that have been sent to them. After this,
<TT>RSIM_EVENT</TT> loops on to the next processor.
<P>
Each of the functions mentioned above is more thoroughly discussed in
the chapter related to its phase of execution. In particular,
<TT>CompleteQueues</TT>, <TT>update_cycle</TT>, <TT>graduate_cycle</TT>, <TT>maindecode</TT>,
<TT>decode_cycle</TT>, and <TT>IssueQueues</TT> are part of the out-of-order
execution engine, which is discussed in the next several sections.
