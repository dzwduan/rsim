The <TT>CompleteQueues</TT> function processes
instructions from the <TT>Running</TT> heap that have completed in a
given cycle. For all non-memory instructions, this function calls
the appropriate emulation function from <TT>src/Processor/funcs.cc</TT>
and then inserts the <TT>instance</TT> onto the processor's <TT>DoneHeap</TT>.
For memory instructions, this function marks the completion of address
generation, and thus calls the <TT>Disambiguate</TT> function (described
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#rsimproc_memunit">11</A>). This function is also responsible for
freeing functional units that have completed their functional unit
delay, as determined from the <TT>FreeingUnits</TT> data structure. As
each functional unit is freed, the processor checks to see if a queue
of ready instructions has built up waiting for that unit. If so, one
instruction is revived, and the <TT>issue</TT> function is invoked.
<P>
The function <TT>update_cycle</TT> processes instructions from the
<TT>DoneHeap</TT> data structure. For each instruction removed from
the <TT>DoneHeap</TT> in a cycle, <TT>update_cycle</TT> first sees if the
completion of this instruction will allow a stalled processor to continue
decoding instructions.
<P>
Next, <TT>update_cycle</TT> resolves completed branches.  If the branch
was unpredicted, <TT>update_cycle</TT> sets the processor PC and NPC
appropriately and allows execution to continue.  On a correct
prediction, the <TT>GoodPrediction</TT> function is called. If
this branch had already allocated a shadow mapper, this
function calls <TT>RemoveFromBranchQ</TT> to free the shadow mapper, possibly
yielding that shadow mapper to a later stalled branch. If the branch
had not yet received a shadow mapper, it is no longer considered to
be stalled for a mapper.
<P>
On the other hand, the <TT>BadPrediction</TT> function is called to
resolve a mispredicted branch. If the branch (or its delay slot, as
approriate) had allocated a shadow mapper, <TT>CopyBranchQ</TT> is used
to revive the correct register mapping table. After that, <TT>
FlushBranchQ</TT> is used to remove the shadow mapper associated with the
current branch and all later branches. Then, <TT>FlushMems</TT> is
invoked to remove all instructions from the memory unit after the
branch or delay slot in question.  <TT>FlushStallQ</TT> removes any
possible item in the processor stall queue, and is followed by <TT>
FlushActiveList</TT>, which removes all instructions after the branch or
delay slot from the active list. <TT>FlushActiveList</TT> also removes
entries from the tag-converter data structure, frees the
registers renamed as destinations for the instructions being flushed, and negates the
effects of any register windowing operations being flushed. After <TT>
BadPrediction</TT> returns control to <TT>update_cycle</TT>, the processor
sets its PC and NPC appropriately.
<P>
<TT>update_cycle</TT> then updates the physical register file with the
results of the completed instruction and marks the instruction in the
active list as having completed. The busy-bits of the destination
registers are cleared, and the instructions in the distributed stall
queue for these registers are checked. If a waiting instruction now
has no more true dependencies, the function <TT>SendToFU</TT> is called
to provide the register values to that instruction and possibly allow
it to issue.  If a memory instruction in the memory unit had been
waiting on a destination register for an address dependence which is
now cleared, the <TT>CalculateAddress</TT> function (described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#rsimproc_memunit">11</A>) is used to send the instruction to the
address generation unit.
