<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1: Checking status of MSHR entry</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For a <TT>REPLY</TT>, the function <TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> uses
the <TT>FindInMshrEntries</TT> function to find the MSHR number corresponding to
the <TT>REPLY</TT>.
<P>
If there is no MSHR entry for the <TT>REPLY</TT>, then it must be a response to a
non-allocated write or to an L2 prefetch <TT>REQUEST</TT>. For such a <TT>REPLY</TT>,
<TT>
GlobalPerformAndHeapInsertAllCoalesced</TT> should be immediately called.
This function calls the <TT>GlobalPerform</TT> function for the corresponding <TT>REQUEST</TT>
and any other <TT>REQUEST</TT>s that may have coalesced with this <TT>REQUEST</TT> at
the write-buffer or L2 cache, while also inserting the <TT>REPLY</TT>s into
the <TT>MemDoneHeap</TT> described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#rsimproc_memunit">11</A>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 2: Processing <TT>REPLY</TT>s that match an MSHR</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
If the <TT>REPLY</TT> matches an MSHR, the function <TT>GetCoheReq</TT> is used
to determine if any coherence message coalesced into the MSHR
while it was outstanding. If so, any possible effects of this coherence
message will be processed along with the <TT>REPLY</TT>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 2a: Processing upgrade <TT>REPLY</TT>s</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For upgrades, the <TT>REPLY</TT> handler calls the cache's coherence routine
to determine the final state of the cache line. If any writes are present
in the MSHR for the cache line and the state of the line is exclusive, the state
changes to modified. If a <TT>COHE</TT> was merged into the MSHR,
its effect on the cache line state is now carried out. (Note: no coherence
message that requires a copyback or cache-to-cache transfer will ever
merge into an MSHR, as discussed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node105.html#rsimmemsys_cache_l1proctagreq_cohe">13.3.3</A>.)
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 2b: Processing cache miss <TT>REPLY</TT>s</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For cache misses (<TT>REPLY</TT>s other than upgrades), the <TT>REPLY</TT>
handler calls either <TT>
premiss_ageupdate</TT> or <TT>miss_ageupdate</TT> based on whether or not the
line is a ``present miss'' (a line whose tag remains in cache after a
<TT>COHE</TT>, but is in an <TT>INVALID</TT> state).
<P>
If the line is
not a ``present miss'', the <TT>miss_ageupdate</TT> function tries to find a
possible replacement candidate. If any set entry is <TT>INVALID</TT>,
this line is used so as to avoid replacement. If a line must be
replaced, then the least-recently used <TT>SH_CL</TT> line is used; if
none is available, the least-recently used <TT>PR_CL</TT> or, finally,
<TT>PR_DY</TT> line is used<A NAME="tex2html28" HREF="footnode.html#2219"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
If no victim is available because all lines
in the set have upgrades pending, the <TT>REPLY</TT> is not taken and
a message needs to be sent back to the sender.
This is done in the 
<TT>NackUpgradeConflictReply</TT> function.
This function uses the MSHR allocated reserved by the 
<TT>REQUEST</TT>  corresponding to this rejected <TT>REPLY</TT> as a resource
from which to issue the new message. This resource
is added to the smart MSHR list simulator abstraction (discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node101.html#rsimmemsys_cache_process">13.2</A>).
<P>
For <TT>REPLY</TT>s that do find a space in which to  insert the new line,
the cache's
coherence routine is  called to determine the state for the
new line being brought in.  If any writes are present
in the MSHR for the  cache line and the state of the line is exclusive, the state
changes to modified. If a <TT>COHE</TT> was merged into the MSHR,
its effect on the cache line state will also be carried out.
<P>
If this line replaces a current line, the cache's coherence routine is
called to determine any possible requests that must be sent
as a result. If the variable <TT>blw_req_type</TT> is set, a writeback must be
sent as a result of this replacement (occurs if the victim had been in modified
state). In this case, the <TT>GetReplReq</TT> function must be called to
create a write-back message. This function sets up all the fields for
a new message that writes back the line being replaced. This new
write-back message is sent out in Step&nbsp;3.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 3: Returning replies to processor</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Regardless of <TT>REPLY</TT> type processed, the system now prepares to
remove the corresponding entry from the MSHRs.
<P>
If some non-MSHR accesses (L2
prefetches, writes with a write-through cache) are also coalesced with
the reply, the function <TT>GlobalPerformAndHeapInsertAllCoalescedWritesOnly</TT>
or <TT>GlobalPerformAndHeapInsertAllCoalescedL2PrefsOnly</TT> is called to
provide replies all of them to the processor.
<P>
Then, <TT>MSHRIterateUncoalesce</TT> is called, passing through all the
responses coalesced into the <TT>REPLY</TT> and the MSHR itself and
informing the processor of these.
<P>
If this reply does not cause a write-back, its MSHR is
freed. Otherwise, the MSHR is temporarily used as storage space for
the write-back, and will be thus held until the write-back is able to
issue from the MSHR to the next level of cache. As with other resources
held to issue messages to the ports, the MSHR is added to the smart MSHR list.
<P>
<TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> does not currently account for cache fill time.
