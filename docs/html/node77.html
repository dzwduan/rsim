<P>
<P>
Since RSIM currently does not model an instruction cache, the
instruction fetch and decode peline stages are merged. This stage
starts with the function <TT>decode_cycle</TT>, called from <TT>
maindecode</TT>.
<P>
The function <TT>decode_cycle</TT> starts out by looking in the
processor stall queue, which consists of instructions that were
decoded in a previous cycle but could not be added to the processor
active list, either because of insufficient renaming registers or
insufficient active list size. The processor will stop decoding new
instructions by setting the processor field <TT>stall_the_rest</TT>
after the first stall of this sort, so the stall queue should have at
most one element. If there is an instruction in the stall queue, <TT>
check_dependencies</TT> is called for it (described below). If this
function succeeds, the instruction is removed from the processor stall
queue. Otherwise, the processor continues to stall instruction
decoding.
<P>
After processing the stall queue, the processor will decode the
instructions for the current cycle. If the program counter is valid
for the application instruction region, the processor will read the
instruction at that program counter, and convert the static <TT>
instr</TT> data strucutre to a dynamic <TT>instance</TT> data structure
through the function <TT>decode_instruction</TT>. The <TT>instance</TT> is
the fundamental dynamic form of the instruction that is passed among
the various functions in RSIM. If the program counter is not valid for
the application, the processor checks to see if the processor is in
privileged mode. If so, and if the program counter points to a valid
instruction in the trap-table, the
processor reads an instruction from the trap-table instead. If the
processor is not in privileged mode, or the PC is not valid in the
trap-table, the processor generates a single invalid instruction that
will cause an illegal PC exception. Such a PC can arise through either an
illegal branch or jump, or through speculation (in which case the
invalid instruction will be flushed before it causes a trap).
<P>
The <TT>decode_instruction</TT> function sets a variety of fields in the
<TT>instance</TT> data structure. First, the various fields associated
with the memory unit are cleared, and some fields associated with
instruction registers and results are cleared. The relevant statistics
fields are also initialized.
<P>
Then, the <TT>tag</TT> field of the <TT>instance</TT> is set to hold
the value of the processor instruction counter. The <TT>tag</TT> field is
the unique instruction id of the <TT>instance</TT>; currently, this field
is set to be unique for each processor throughout the course of a
simulation. Then, the <TT>win_num</TT> field of the instance is
set. This represents the processor's register window pointer (<TT>
cwp</TT> or current window pointer) at the time of decoding this
instruction.
<P>
<TT>decode_instruction</TT> then sets the functional unit type and
initializes dependence fields for this <TT>instance</TT>.  Additionally,
the <TT>stall_the_rest</TT> field of the processor is cleared; since a
new instruction is being decoded, it is now up to the progress of this
instruction to determine whether or not the processor will stall.
<P>
At this point, the <TT>instance</TT> must determine its logical source
registers and the physical registers to which they are mapped. In the
case of integer registers (which may be windowed), the function <TT>
convert_to_logical</TT> is called to convert from a window number and
architectural register number to an integer register identifier that
identifies the logical register number used to index into the register map table
(which does not account for register windows).
If an invalid source register number is specified, the
instruction will be marked with an illegal instruction trap.
<P>
At this point, the <TT>instance</TT> must handle the case where it is an
instruction that will change the processor's register window pointer
(such as <TT>SAVE</TT> or <TT>RESTORE</TT>).  The processor provides two
fields (<TT>CANSAVE</TT> and <TT>CANRESTORE</TT>) that identify the number
of windowing operations that can be allowed to
proceed&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>]. If the processor can not handle the current
windowing operation, this instance must be marked with a register
window trap, which will later be processed by the appropriate trap
handler.  Otherwise, the <TT>instance</TT> will change its <TT>win_num</TT>
to reflect the new register window number.
<P>
In a release consistent system, the processor will now detect <TT>
MEMBAR</TT> operations and note the imposed ordering constraints.  These
constraints will be used by the memory unit.
<P>
The <TT>instance</TT> will now determine its logical destination register
numbers, which will later be used in the renaming stage.  If the
previous instruction was a delayed branch, it would have set the processor's
<TT>copymappernext</TT> field (as described below). If the <TT>copymappernext</TT> field is set,
then this instruction
is the delay slot of the previous delayed branch and must try to allocate a shadow
mapper. The <TT>branchdep</TT> field of the <TT>instance</TT> is set to
indicate this.
<P>
Now the processor PC and NPC are stored with each created <TT>
instance</TT>.  We store program counters with each instruction not to
imitate the actual behavior of a system, but rather as a simulator
abstraction.  If the <TT>instance</TT> is a branch instruction, the
function <TT>decode_branch_instruction</TT> is called to predict or set
the new program counter values; otherwise, the PC is updated to the
NPC, and the NPC is incremented. <TT>decode_branch_instruction</TT> may
also set the <TT>branchdep</TT> field of the <TT>instance</TT> (for
predicted branches that may annul the delay slot), the <TT>
copymappernext</TT> field of the processor (for predicted, delayed
branches), or the <TT>unpredbranch</TT> field of the processor (for
unpredicted branches).
<P>
If the <TT>instance</TT> is predicted as a taken branch, then the
processor will temporarily set the <TT>stall_the_rest</TT> field to
prevent any further instructions from being decoded this cycle, as we
currently assume that the processor cannot decode instructions from
different regions of the address space in the same cycle.
<P>
After this point, control returns to <TT>decode_cycle</TT>. This
function now adds the decoded instruction to the tag converter, a
structure used to convert from the <TT>tag</TT> of the <TT>instance</TT>
into an <TT>instance</TT> data structure pointers. This structure is
used internally for communication among the modules of the simulator.
<P>
Now the <TT>check_dependencies</TT> function is called for the dynamic
instruction. If RSIM was invoked with the ``-q'' option and there are
too many unissued instructions to allow this one into the issue
window, this function will stall further decoding and return.  If RSIM
was invoked with the ``-X'' option for static scheduling and even one
prior instruction is still waiting to issue (to the ALU, FPU, 
or address generation unit), further decoding is stopped and
this function returns.
Otherwise,
this function will attempt to provide renaming registers for each of
the destination registers of this instruction, stalling if there are
none available. As each register is remapped in this fashion, the old
mapping is added to the active list (so that the appropriate register
will be freed when this instruction graduates), again stalling if
the active list
has filled up. It is only after this point that a windowing
instruction actually changes the register window pointer of the
processor, updating the <TT>CANSAVE</TT> and <TT>CANRESTORE</TT> fields
appropriately. Note that single-precision floating point registers
(referred to as <TT>REG_FPHALF</TT>) are mapped and renamed according to
double-precision boundaries to account for the register-pairing
present in the SPARC architecutre&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>]. As a result,
single-precision floating point codes are likely to experience
significantly poorer performance than double-precision codes, actually
experiencing the negative effects of anti-dependences and
output-dependences which are otherwise resolved by register renaming.
<P>
If a resource was not available at any point above, <TT>
check_dependencies</TT> will set <TT>stall_the_rest</TT> and return an
error code, allowing the <TT>instance</TT> to be added to the stall
queue. Although the simulator assumes that there are enough renaming
registers for the specified active-list size by default, <TT>
check_dependences</TT> also includes code to stall if the instruction
could not obtain its desired renaming registers.
<P>
After the <TT>instance</TT> has received its renaming registers and
active list space, <TT>check_dependences</TT> continues with further
processing.
If the instruction requires a shadow mapper (has <TT>branchdep</TT> set to
2, as described above), the processor tries to allocate a shadow mapper by calling <TT>
AddBranchQ</TT>. If a shadow mapper is available, the <TT>branchdep</TT>
field is cleared.  Otherwise, the <TT>stall_the_rest</TT> field of the
processor is set and the <TT>instance</TT> is added to the queue of
instructions waiting for shadow mappers. If the processor had its <TT>
unpredbranch</TT> field set, the <TT>stall_the_rest</TT> field is set,
either at the branch itself (on an annulling branch), or at the delay
slot (for a non-annulling delayed branch).
<P>
The <TT>instance</TT> now checks for outstanding register dependences.
The <TT>instance</TT> checks the busy bit of each source register (for
single-precision floating-point operations, this includes the
destination register as well). For each busy bit that is set, the
instruction is put on a <EM>distributed stall queue</EM> for the
appropriate register. If any busy bit is set, the <TT>truedep</TT> field
is set to 1. If the busy bits of <TT>rs2</TT> or <TT>rscc</TT> are set, the
<TT>addrdep</TT> field is set to 1 (this field is used to allow memory
operations to generate their addresses while the source registers for
their value might still be outstanding).
<P>
If the instruction is a memory operation, it is now dispatched to the
memory unit, if there is space for it. If there is no space, either
the operation is attached to a queue of instructions waiting for the
memory unit (if the processor has dynamic scheduling and ``-q'' was not used to invoke RSIM), or the processor
is stalled until space is available (if the processor has
static scheduling, or has dynamic scheduling with the ``-q'' option to
RSIM).
<P>
If the instruction has no true dependences, the <TT>SendToFU</TT>
function is called to allow this function to issue in the next stage.
<P>
<TT>decode_cycle</TT> continues looping until it decodes all the
instructions it can (and is allowed to by the architectural specifications)
in a given cycle.
