The <TT>SMMODULE</TT> data structure contains a basic module framework
that is used by many of the modules in the memory system
simulator. This framework includes fields common to all the module
types, and is initialized using the <TT>ModuleInit</TT> function. This
function sets the node number for the module, along with fields
related to the module's input and output ports.  These ports, which
are of the type <TT>SMPORT</TT>, are used to connect between the various
modules in the memory system simulator. <TT>SMPORT</TT> data structures
act as queues between the various modules and have memory system
simulator messages as their entries. (These messages are described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#memsys_req">12.2</A>.) Each queue has a fixed maximum size,
initialized by the call to <TT>ModuleInit</TT> (but possibly modified
using <TT>QueueSizeCorrect</TT> later). Note that only output ports
are actually created; the input ports of one module are set to 
the same data structures as the output ports of another module using the
<TT>ModuleConnect</TT> function described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node97.html#memsys_init">12.3</A>.
<P>
Each module also has a <EM>routing</EM> function, which generates the
output port number for each type of message that leaves the module.
The various modules and default port connections used in RSIM are shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node91.html#port_connects">12.1</A>. Input ports are shown on this figure as <TT>
i<EM>X</EM></TT>, where <EM>X</EM> is the port number; similarly, output ports
are shown as <TT>o<EM>X</EM></TT>. The terms <EM>Request</EM>, <EM>Reply</EM>,
<EM>Cohe</EM>, and <EM>Cohe reply</EM> correspond to the types of memory
system messages, as explained in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#memsys_req">12.2</A>.
If no write-buffer is included, port <TT>o1</TT> of the L1 cache
connects directly to port <TT>i0</TT> of the L2 cache, while port
<TT>o0</TT>  of the L2 cache connects to port <TT>i1</TT> of the L1 cache.
<P>
RSIM uses a single module for each bank of the directory and memory.
The input and output ports connecting the directory and memory to the bus
are listed in the form <TT>o6,8,...</TT> to indicate that each interleaved
bank has a separate port in place of the single port shown on the diagram.
<P>
The network interface is shown on the diagram as being split into two
parts, <EM>Send</EM> and <EM>Receive</EM>. <EM>Send</EM> moves new messages from
the node to the multiprocessor interconnection network, while <EM>Receive</EM>
brings messages from the interconnection network into the node.
Note that the network system and its connections to the network interface
do not use the standard <TT>SMMODULE</TT> and <TT>SMPORT</TT> data structures
used by the rest of the memory system simulator. The data structures
for the network and its connections to the network interface are explained
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node124.html#rsimmemsys_net">15.3</A>.

The queue sizes for the various ports are configurable at run-time,
as discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#cmd_line">4</A>. The size of the queue
specifies the number of transactions of any type (request or response)
that can be held in the connection between the modules at any given time.
If the size of the queue configured at runtime differs from that originally
initialized with <TT>ModuleInit</TT>, the <TT>QueueSizeCorrect</TT> function
is called to set the sizes of these ports to the desired values.
Note that the port queue size also limits the number of
requests that can be processed by the module each time the module
is activated. For example, if a cache is intended to start processing
four requests each cycle, the request port queue should contain
at least four entries.
<P>
The port queue can also contain more than the minimum
number of entries; in these cases, the queue acts as a buffer to decouple
a faster module from a slower module. For this reason, the default
port sizes from the L2 cache to the bus are larger than most of the other
cache ports; these port sizes are chosen so that the potentially slow
processing rate of the bus will not cause the L2 cache itself to stall.
<P>
The implementation of port queues is such that 
each port queue holds one of its entries as an ``overflow entry.''
Thus, most of the modules subtract 1 from the port queue sizes specified
before calling <TT>ModuleInit</TT> or <TT>QueueSizeCorrect</TT>, as this accounts
for the separate overflow entry provided. The network
interface module does not use the overflow request; these units stop
adding to their output ports before allowing the queues to fill up
the overflow request.
