Completion of memory references takes
place in two parts. First, the <TT>GlobalPerform</TT> function is called
at the level of the memory hierarchy which responds to the
reference.
This function calls the function associated
with this instruction (as specified in <TT>src/Processor/funcs.cc</TT>) to
actually read a value from or write a value into the UNIX address space
of the simulator environment. In the case of virtual store-buffer forwards,
the value taken by the load is the value forwarded from the buffer rather
than that in the address space. In the case of accesses which are
not simulated, this behavior takes place as part of the <TT>CompleteMemOp</TT>
function (described below).
<P>
Then, when a reference is ready to return from the caches, the <TT>
MemDoneHeapInsert</TT> function is called to mark the instruction for
completion. In the case of non-simulated accesses, the access is put
into the <TT>MemDoneHeap</TT> by the <TT>memory_latency</TT> function
invoked at the time of issue.
<P>
The function <TT>CompleteMemQueue</TT> processes instructions from the
<TT>MemDoneHeap</TT> of the processor by calling <TT>CompleteMemOp</TT> for
each instruction to complete in a given cycle. The corresponding
instruction emulation function is called for accesses that were not
simulated at the caches. For loads, this function first checks whether
or not a soft exception has been marked on the load for either address
disambiguation or consistency constraints while it was outstanding. If
this has occurred, this load must be forced to re-issue, but does not actually
need to take an exception. Otherwise, this function checks to see whether
the <TT>limbo</TT> field for the load must be set (that is, if any previous
stores still have not generated their addresses), or whether the load
must be redone (if a previous store disambiguated to an address that overlaps
with the load). If the load does not need to be redone and either does
not have a <TT>limbo</TT> set or has a processor in which values
can be passed down from <TT>limbo</TT> loads (as discussed above), the
function <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> is called to note that the value produced by this
instruction is
ready for use. The function <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> is called
for all stores to reach <TT>CompleteMemOp</TT>.
<P>
<TT>PerformMemOp</TT> has two functions: removing instructions from the
memory unit and passing values down from <TT>limbo</TT> loads. In the
case of RC, <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> always removes the operation from
either the memory unit or virtual store buffer (as appropriate) except
in the case of loads that are either marked with a <TT>limbo</TT> field
or past a <TT>MEMBAR</TT> that blocks loads. In SC, memory operations
must leave the memory unit strictly in order. The constraints for PC
are identical to those for SC, except that loads may leave the memory
unit past outstanding stores. In no memory model may <TT>limbo</TT> loads
leave the memory unit before all previous stores have disambiguated.
If the memory unit policy allows values to be passed down from
<TT>limbo</TT> loads, <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> fulfills some of the duties
otherwise associated with the <TT>update_cycle</TT> function (filling
in physical register values and clearing the busy bit and distributed
stall queues for the destination register). Note that <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> will
be called again for the same instruction when the <TT>limbo</TT> flag is
cleared or, in the case of RC, when prior memory fences have been cleared.
<P>
If the system supports speculative load execution to improve the
performance of its consistency model (with the ``-K'' option), the
constraints enforced by <TT>PerformMemOp</TT> will be sufficient to
guarantee that no speculative load leaves the memory unit. Each coherence
message received at the L1 cache because of an
external invalidation or a replacement from the lowest level of local
cache (L2 in our case) must be sent to the memory unit through the <TT>
SpecLoadBufCohe</TT> function. If such a message invalidates or updates a
cache line accessed by any outstanding or completed speculative
load access, that access is marked with a soft exception. If the
access is still oustanding, the soft exception will be ignored and the
load will be forced to reissue; if the access has completed, the
exception must be taken in order to guarantee that the load or any
later operations do not commit incorrect values into the architectural
state of the processor&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#KouroshGupta1991b">5</A>, <A HREF="node132.html#MIPSR10KMICRO">28</A>].
