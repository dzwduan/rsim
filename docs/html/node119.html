<P>
If <TT>s.reply</TT> is set to <TT>NACK</TT>, the <TT>COHE_REPLY</TT> indicates that the line
missed in the remote cache. This response type is acceptable and
handled like a positive acknowledgment unless
the  <TT>COHE</TT> message from the directory
was sent with <TT>NACK_NOK</TT>. <TT>NACK_NOK</TT> indicates that
the coherence message specifically
expected that data would be transfered. In this case, the cache must have
issued a write-back or replacement message just prior to receiving
the coherence message in
question. If this write-back or replacement has not yet been received,
the original
<TT>REQUEST</TT> that started the coherence transaction sequence is sent
back to its cache with an <TT>RAR</TT> to be retried. (If the <TT>RAR</TT>
cannot be
sent immediately, the directory puts it in <TT>OutboundReqs</TT> to be tried
later). If the write-back has been received at the directory, though, the
original <TT>REQUEST</TT> can be reprocessed through the standard directory
request-handling case.
<P>
On <TT>NACK_PEND</TT> coherence replies, the directory is expected to reevaluate
its status and resend the <TT>COHE</TT> request if needed. A response of
<TT>NACK_PEND</TT> is sent from the cache in certain cases of  a <TT>COHE</TT>
received for a line with an outstanding MSHR.  Such a race can occur 
either if the cache sent a write-back or replacement message before the
directory sent out the <TT>COHE</TT> or if the <TT>COHE</TT> was received
by the cache before the <TT>REPLY</TT>, which had been sent to the cache earlier.
If the directory 
has received a write-back for the line in question from the node that
responded with a <TT>NACK_PEND</TT>,
the original <TT>REQUEST</TT> is reprocessed by the normal request handler.
Otherwise, the coherence message is retried again, as it may have
been <TT>NACK_PEND</TT>ed only because it bypassed an earlier <TT>REPLY</TT>.
