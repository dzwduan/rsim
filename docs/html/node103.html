<H2><A NAME="SECTION03731000000000000000">Handling <TT>REQUEST</TT> type</A></H2>
<P>
For <TT>REQUEST</TT>s, <TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> first checks the tag in
the tag array and in the outstanding MSHRs by calling <TT>
notpres_mshr</TT>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1: Calling <TT>notpres_mshr</TT></B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For a <TT>REQUEST</TT>, <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> first checks to see if the
request has a tag that matches any of the outstanding
MSHRs. Additionally, the <TT>notpres</TT> function is called to determine
if the desired line is available in the cache. If the line is not
present in any MSHR, the coherence routine for the cache (<TT>
cohe_pr</TT> for L1, <TT>cohe_sl</TT> for L2) is called to determine the
appropriate actions for this line, based on whether or not the line is
present, the current MESI state of the line in cache, and the type of
cache.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1a: Behavior of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> when <TT>REQUEST</TT> does not match MSHR</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
If the <TT>REQUEST</TT> being processed does not match an outstanding MSHR,
the operation of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> depends on whether or not the line hits
in the cache and the state of the line.
<P>
If the line being accessed hits in the cache in an acceptable state,
this request will not require a request to a lower module. As a
result, the cache will return <TT>NOMSHR</TT>, indicating that no MSHR
was involved or needed in this request<A NAME="tex2html26" HREF="footnode.html#2212"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
If the request goes to the next level of cache without taking an MSHR
at this cache level (either by being a write in a write-through cache or an L2
prefetch), the value <TT>NOMSHR_FWD</TT> is returned to indicate that no
MSHR was required, but that the request must be sent forward.
<P>
If the request
needs a new MSHR, but none are available, the value <TT>NOMSHR_STALL</TT>
is returned. In the case of the L2 cache, a request that is not able
to reserve a space in the write-back buffer leads to a <TT>
NOMSHR_STALL_WRBBUF_FULL</TT> return value.
<P>
Otherwise, the cache books an MSHR and
returns a response based on whether this access was a complete miss
(<TT>MSHR_NEW</TT>) or an upgrade request (<TT>MSHR_FWD</TT>). In the case
of upgrades, the line is locked into cache by setting <TT>mshr_out</TT>;
this guarantees that the line is not victimized on a later <TT>REPLY</TT>
before the upgrade reply returns. In all cases where the line is present
in cache, the <TT>hit_update</TT> function is called to update the ages of the
lines in the set (for LRU replacement).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1b: Behavior of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> when <TT>REQUEST</TT> matches MSHR</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the <TT>REQUEST</TT> matches a current MSHR, the
operation of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT> depends on the type of the <TT>REQUEST</TT> and
the previous accesses to the matching MSHR.
<P>
If the access is a shared prefetch or an exclusive prefetch to an MSHR
returning in exclusive state, the prefetch is not necessary because
a fetch is already in progress. In this case, this function returns
<TT>MSHR_USELESS_FETCH_IN_PROGRESS</TT> to indicate that the
<TT>REQUEST</TT> should be dropped.
<P>
If the access is an L2 prefetch or an exclusive prefetch in the
case of a write-through L1 cache, the <TT>REQUEST</TT> should be forwarded
around the cache. In this case, the function returns <TT>NOMSHR_FWD</TT>.
If the request was an exclusive prefetch, it is converted to an L2 exclusive
prefetch before being forwarded around the cache.
<P>
In certain cases, the <TT>REQUEST</TT> may need to be stalled.
Possible scenarios that can result in stalls and the values they
return are as follows. If the MSHR is being temporarily held for a
write-back, <TT>notpres_mshr</TT>
returns <TT>MSHR_STALL_WRB</TT>. If the MSHR is marked with an
unacceptable pending coherence message, the function returns
<TT>MSHR_STALL_COHE</TT>. If the MSHR already has the
maximum number of coalesced <TT>REQUEST</TT>s for an MSHR, the
return value is <TT>MSHR_STALL_COAL</TT>. The maximum number of
coalesced accesses is a configurable parameter.
Finally, when a write (or exclusive prefetch) <TT>REQUEST</TT> comes to
the same line as an MSHR held for a read (or shared prefetch) <TT>
REQUEST</TT>, the value <TT>MSHR_STALL_WAR</TT> is returned. This last case
can significantly affect the performance of hardware
store-prefetching, and is called a <EM>WAR stall</EM><A NAME="tex2html27" HREF="footnode.html#1915"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>. The impact of WAR stalls can be reduced through software prefetching, as
an exclusive prefetch can be sent before either the read or write
accesses&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#PaiRanganathan1996a">15</A>, <A HREF="node132.html#RanganathanPai1997a">16</A>].
<P>
If the access was not dropped, forwarded, or stalled, it is a valid
access that can be processed by merging with the current MSHR. In this
circumstance, the cache merges the request with the current MSHR and
returns <TT>MSHR_COAL</TT>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 2: Processing based on the results of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT></B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<TT>L1ProcessTagReq</TT> continues processing the <TT>REQUEST</TT> based on
the return value of <TT>notpres_mshr</TT>.
<P>
For a hit (<TT>NOMSHR</TT>), the
request is marked as a hit and returned to the processor through the
<TT>GlobalPerformAndHeapInsertAllCoalesced</TT> function.
<P>
For new misses (<TT>MSHR_NEW</TT>), upgrades (<TT>MSHR_FWD</TT>),
or write-throughs (<TT>NOMSHR_FWD</TT>), the cache attempts to send the
request down, returning a successful value if the request is sent
successfully.
<P>
For <TT>MSHR_COAL</TT>, the element is considered to have
been processed successfully.
<P>
On <TT>MSHR_USELESS_FETCH_IN_PROGRESS</TT>,
the request is dropped.
<P>
For each of the stall cases, the processing is generally considered
incomplete, and the function returns 0 to indicate this. However, if
the stalled request is a prefetch and <TT>DISCRIMINATE_PREFETCH</TT> has
been set with the ``-T'' option, the request is dropped and
processing is considered successful.  Note that <TT>
DISCRIMINATE_PREFETCH</TT> cannot be used to drop prefetches at the L2 cache,
as these prefetches may already hold MSHRs with
other coalesced requests at the L1 cache.
