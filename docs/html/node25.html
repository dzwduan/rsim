The processor memory unit is the interface between the processor
and the caches. 
Currently, instruction caches are not simulated and are
assumed to be perfect.  RSIM also does not currently support virtual
memory<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="footnode.html#336"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
A processor's accesses to its private data space (described
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#apps_memmodel">5.1</A>) are currently considered to be cache hits in
all multiprocessor simulations and in uniprocessor simulations
configured for this purpose.  
However, contention at all processor and cache resources
and all memory ordering constraints
are modeled for private accesses in all cases.
<P>
The most important responsibility of the processor memory unit
is to insure that memory instructions occur in the correct order.
There are three types of ordering constraints that must be upheld:
<P>
<OL><LI>	Constraints to guarantee precise exceptions<LI>	Constraints to satisfy uniprocessor data dependences<LI>	Constraints due to the multiprocessor memory consistency model
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Constraints for precise exceptions</B>
<P>
The RSIM memory system
supports non-blocking loads and stores.  To maintain precise
exceptions, a store cannot issue before it is ready to be graduated;
namely, it must be one of the instructions to graduate in the next
cycle and all previous instructions must have completed successfully.
A store can be allowed to graduate, as it does not need
to maintain a space in the active list for any later dependences.
However, if it is not able to issue to the cache before graduating, it
must hold a slot in the memory unit until it is actually sent to the
cache.  The store can leave the memory unit as soon as it has issued,
unless the multiprocessor memory constraints require the store to
remain in the unit.
<P>
Loads always wait until completion before leaving the memory unit
or graduating, as loads must write a destination register value.
Prefetches can leave the memory unit as soon as they are issued to
the cache, as these instructions have no destination register
value. Furthermore, there are no additional
constraints on the graduation of prefetches.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Constraints for uniprocessor data depedences</B>
<P>
These constraints require that a processor's conflicting loads and stores (to
the same address) appear to execute in program order. The precise exception
constraint ensures that this condition holds for two stores and for a load
followed by a store. For a store followed by a load, the processor
may need to maintains this data dependence by enforcing additional
constraints on the execution of the load. If the load has generated
its address, the state of the store address determines whether or not
the load can issue. Specifically, the prior store must be in
one of the following
three categories:
<P>
<OL><LI>	address is known, non-conflicting<LI>	address is known, conflicting<LI>	address is unknown
</OL>
<P>
In the first case, there is no data dependence from the store
to the load. As a result, the load can issue to the cache in all
configuration options, as long as the multiprocessor ordering constraints
allow the load to proceed.
<P>
In the second case, the processor knows that there is a data dependence
from the store to the load. If the store matches  the load address exactly,
the load can
forward its return value from the value of the store in the memory
unit without ever having to issue to cache, if the multiprocessor
ordering constraints allow this. If the load address and
the store address only partially overlap, the load may have to stall
until the store has completed at the caches; such a stall is called a
<EM>partial overlap</EM>, and is discussed further in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#rsimproc_memunit">11</A>.
<P>
In the third case, however, the load may or may not have a data
dependence on the previous store. The behavior of the RSIM memory unit
in this situation depends on the configuration options.
In the default RSIM configuration, the load is allowed to issue to the cache,
if allowed by the multiprocessor ordering constraints. When the load
data returns from the cache, the load will be allowed to complete unless there
is still a prior store with an unknown or conflicting address. If a prior
store is now known to have a conflicting address, the load must either
attempt to reissue or forward a value from the store as appropriate.
If a prior store still has an unknown address, the load remains in the
memory unit, but clears the busy bit of its destination register,
allowing further instructions to use the value of the load. However, if a prior
store is later disambiguated and is found to conflict with a later
completed load, the load is marked with a <EM>soft exception</EM>, which
flushes the value of that load and all subsequent
instructions. Soft-exception handling is discussed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#rpipes_except">3.2.4</A>.
<P>
There are two less aggressive variations provided on this default
policy for handling the third case.  The first scheme is similar
to the default policy; however, the busy bit of the load is not
cleared until all prior stores have completed. Thus, if a
prior store is later found to have a conflicting address, the
instruction must only be forced to reissue, rather than to take a
soft exception.  However, later instructions cannot use the value of the
load until all prior stores have been disambiguated.
<P>
The second memory unit variation stalls the issue of the load
altogether whenever a prior store has an unknown address.
<P>
<P>
<B>Constraints for multiprocessor memory consistency model</B>.
<P>
RSIM supports memory systems 
three types of multiprocessor memory consistency protocols:
<P>
<UL><LI> Relaxed memory ordering (RMO)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>] and release consistency (RC)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#KouroshLenoski1990">6</A>]<LI> Sequential consistency (SC)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Lamport1979">11</A>]<LI> Processor consistency (PC)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#KouroshLenoski1990">6</A>] and total store ordering (TSO)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1991">26</A>]
</UL>
<P>
Each of these memory models is supported with a straightforward
implementation and optimized implementations. We first describe
the straightforward implementation and then the more optimized implementations
for each of these models.
<P>
The <EM>relaxed memory ordering</EM> (RMO)  model is based on the memory barrier
(or fence) instructions, called <TT>MEMBAR</TT>s, 
in the SPARC V9 ISA&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>].
Multiprocessor ordering constraints are imposed only with respect
to these fence instructions.
A SPARC V9 <TT>MEMBAR</TT> can specify one or more of several ordering options.
An example of a commonly used class of <TT>MEMBAR</TT> is a
<TT>LoadStore</TT> <TT>MEMBAR</TT>, which orders all loads (by program order) before
the <TT>MEMBAR</TT> with respect to all stores following the <TT>MEMBAR</TT> (by
program order).  Other common forms of <TT>MEMBAR</TT> instructions include
<TT>StoreStore</TT>, <TT>LoadLoad</TT>, and combinations of the above formed
by bitwise or (e.g. <TT>LoadLoad|LoadStore</TT>). Instructions
that are ordered by the above <TT>MEMBAR</TT> instructions must appear to
execute in program order. Additionally, RSIM supports the <TT>MemIssue</TT>
class of <TT>MEMBAR</TT>, which forces all previous memory accesses to have
been globally performed before any later instructions can be initiated;
this precludes the use of the optimized consistency implementations described
below<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="footnode.html#448"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
<EM>Release consistency</EM> is implemented using RMO with <TT>
LoadLoad|LoadStore</TT> fences after acquire operations and <TT>
LoadStore|StoreStore</TT> fences before release operations.
<P>
In the <EM>sequential consistency</EM> (SC) memory model, all operations must
appear to execute in strictly serial order. The straightforward implementation of SC
enforces this constraint by actually serializing all memory instructions;
i.e. a load or store is issued to the cache only after the previous
memory instruction by program order is globally performed<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="footnode.html#377"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#ScheurichDubois1987">19</A>].
Further, stores in SC maintain their entries in the memory unit
until they have globally performed to facilitate maintaining multiprocessor
memory ordering dependences from stores to later instructions.
Unless RSIM is invoked with the <EM>store buffering</EM>
command line option (discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#cmd_line">4</A>), stores in
SC do not graduate until they have globally performed.
Forwarding of values from stores to loads inside the memory unit is
not allowed in the straightforward implementation of sequential consistency.
<TT>MEMBAR</TT>s are ignored in the sequential consistency model.
<P>
The <EM>processor consistency</EM> (PC) and <EM>total-store ordering</EM> (TSO)
implementations are identical in RSIM. With these models, stores
are handled just as in sequential consistency with store buffering. Loads are
ordered with respect to other loads, but are not prevented from
issuing, leaving the memory unit, or graduating if only stores
are ahead of them in the memory unit. Processor consistency and
total store ordering also do not impose any
multiprocessor constraints on forwarding values from stores to loads
inside the memory unit, or on loads issuing past stores that have
not yet disambiguated.
<TT>MEMBAR</TT>s are ignored under the processor consistency and total store
ordering models.
<P>
Beyond the above straightforward implementations,
the processor memory unit in RSIM also supports optimized implementations
of memory consistency constraints. These implementations use
two techniques to improve the performance of consistency
implementations: hardware-controlled non-binding prefetching from the
active list and speculative load execution&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#KouroshGupta1991b">5</A>].
<P>
In the straightforward implementations of memory consistency models, a load or
store is prevented from issuing into the memory system whenever it has an outstanding
consistency constraint from a prior instruction that has not yet been
completed at the memory system.
Hardware-controlled non-binding prefetching
from the active
list allows loads or stores in the active list that are blocked for
consistency constraints to be prefetched into the processor's cache.
As a result, the access
is likely to expose less latency when it is issued to the caches
after its consistency constraints have been met.
This technique also allows
exclusive prefetching of stores that have not yet reached the head of
the active list (and which are thus prevented from issuing by the
precise exception constraints).
<P>
Speculative load execution allows the processor not only to prefetch the
cache lines for loads blocked for consistency constraints into the cache, but also to
use the values in these prefetched lines. Values used in this fashion are correct
as long as they are not overwritten by another processor before the
load instruction completes its consistency constraints. The processor
detects potential violations by monitoring coherence actions due to
sharing or replacement at the cache. As in the MIPS R10000, a soft
exception is marked on any speculative load for which such a coherence
action occurs&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#MIPSR10KMICRO">28</A>]; this soft exception will force the
load to reissue and will flush subsequent instructions. The soft exception
mechanism used on violations is the same as the mechanism used in the case
of aggressive speculation of loads beyond stores with unknown addresses.
Speculative load execution can be used in conjunction
with hardware-controlled non-binding prefetching.
