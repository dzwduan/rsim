RSIM supports precise exceptions<A NAME="tex2html10" HREF="footnode.html#449"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> by prohibiting
instructions from committing their effects into the processor
architectural state until the point of graduation.  Excepting
instructions are recognized at the time of graduation.
<P>
RSIM supports the following categories of exceptions: division by
zero, floating point errors, segmentation faults, bus errors, system
traps, window traps, soft exceptions, serializing instructions,
privileged instructions, illegal or unsupported instructions, and
illegal program counter value.  RSIM simply emulates the effects of
most of the trap handlers; a few of the trap handlers actually
have their instructions simulated, and are indicated below. (Soft
exceptions are handled entirely in the hardware and do not
have any associated trap handler.)
<P>
A <EM>division by zero</EM> exception is triggered only on integer division by
zero. <EM>Floating point exceptions</EM> can arise from illegal operands, such 
as attempts to take the square root of a negative number or to perform
certain comparisons of an ``NaN'' with a number. Both of these exception
types are non-recoverable.
<P>
<EM>Segmentation faults</EM> are currently split into two types. The first type
is a fault that occurs whenever a processor wishes to grow its stack
beyond its current limits. For this trap, pages are added to the
stack to accommodate stack growth, and execution recovers from
the point of the excepting instruction.
In the second type of fault,
the processor attempts to access a page of memory that has not been
allocated and is not within the limits of the stack. This type of exception
is nonrecoverable.
<P>
A <EM>bus error</EM> occurs whenever a memory access is not aligned
according to its length. Generally, these exceptions are
nonrecoverable. However, the SPARC architecture allows
double-precision
floating-point loads and
stores to be aligned only to a word boundary, rather than to a
double-word
boundary<A NAME="tex2html11" HREF="footnode.html#395"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>. RSIM currently traps these
accesses and emulates their behavior. However, the cache accesses
for these instructions are not simulated.
<P>
<EM>System traps</EM> are used to emulate the behavior of operating system calls
in RSIM. The system traps supported are listed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node48.html#apps_library">5.2</A> and
serve several important functions, such as I/O, memory allocation, and
process management. Additionally, some system traps are specific to RSIM
and serve roles such as statistics collection or explicitly associating
a home node to a region of shared memory. Some operating system calls
are currently not supported; consequently, functions using these system calls
(such as <TT>strftime</TT> and <TT>signal</TT>) cannot currently be used in 
applications to be simulated with RSIM.
The RSIM simulator trap convention does not currently match the system
trap convention of Solaris or any other operating system; however, a
library is provided with RSIM to insure that the correct system
traps are invoked for each supported function, as described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node48.html#apps_library">5.2</A>.  The system trap handler restarts program
execution at the instruction after the excepting instruction.
<P>
A <EM>window trap</EM> occurs when the call-depth of a window-save chain
exceeds the maximum allowed by RSIM (called an overflow), forcing an
old window to be saved to the stack to make room for the new window,
or when a <TT>RESTORE</TT> operation allows a previously saved window to once
again receive a register window (called an underflow)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node132.html#Sun1993">23</A>].
The instructions used in the window trap handler are actually simulated
by the RSIM processor, rather than merely having their effects emulated.
The window trap handler
returns control to the excepting instruction.
The number of register windows is configurable, and can range from 4
to 32 (in all cases, 1 window is reserved for the system).  The
effect of window traps is not likely to significantly affect the
performance of scientific codes written in C; however, code written in
a functional language such as Scheme or an object-oriented language
such as C++ may experience some performance degradation from
window traps.
<P>
<EM>Soft exceptions</EM> are distinguished from other exception types in that
even a regular system would not need to trap to any operating system code
to handle these exceptions; the exception is handled entirely in
hardware. The active list is flushed, and execution restarts at the
excepting instruction. These are used for recovering from loads incorrectly
issued past stores with unknown addresses or from consistency violations
caused by speculative load execution (as described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#rpipes_mem">3.2.3</A>).
<P>
RSIM uses traps (referred to as <EM>serialization</EM> traps in the code) to implement
certain instructions that either modify system-wide status registers
(e.g. <TT>LDFSR</TT>, <TT>STFSR</TT>) or are outdated instructions with
data-paths that are too complex for a processor with the aggressive
features simulated in RSIM (e.g. <TT>MULScc</TT>).
This can lead to significant
performance degradation in code that uses old libraries, many of which
internally use <TT>MULScc</TT>. The trap handler for the <TT>STFSR</TT>
instruction is actually simulated, rather than merely emulated. The
<TT>LDFSR</TT> instruction is slightly different in that it does not have a trap handler, but functions more like a soft exception. Specifically, the function
of the trap on this instruction is
to prevent later instructions from committing their values
computed with an old floating-point status. Thus, the trap for
<TT>LDFSR</TT> can be thought of as a soft-exception that does
not retry the excepting instruction.
<P>
<EM>Privileged instructions</EM> include instructions that are valid only
in system supervisor mode, and lead to an exception if present in user
code. <EM>Illegal instruction</EM> traps are invalid
instruction encodings and some instructions unsupported by RSIM (i.e.
<TT>tcc</TT>, <TT>flush</TT>, <TT>flushw</TT>, and tagged addition and
subtraction)<A NAME="tex2html12" HREF="footnode.html#450"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> 
An <EM>illegal program counter</EM> value
exception occurs whenever a control transfer instruction makes the
program counter invalid for the instruction address region (e.g. out
of range or unaligned program counters). These three exception types
are all non-recoverable.
