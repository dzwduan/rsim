The <TT>graduate_cycle</TT> function controls the handling associated
with graduation. First, the <TT>remove_from_active_list</TT> function
is called. In this function, the processor looks at the head of the
active list. If this operation completed in the previous cycle (and
thus, has already had time to write its result into its register) and
is not stalled for consistency constraints, the instruction is allowed
to graduate from the active list. If an exception is detected,
graduation is stopped and control is returned to <TT>
graduate_cycle</TT>. If the instruction has no exception, then the old
physical registers for its destinations are freed and the operation is
graduated. As a simulator abstraction, RSIM also maintains a ``logical
register file'', which stores committed values. This file is also
updated at this time. The active list element is removed, and the <TT>
instance</TT> is also freed for later use.  <TT>
remove_from_active_list</TT> repeats until the first operation in the
active list is not ready to graduate, an exception is detected, or the
processor's maximum graduation rate is reached. At that point, control
is returned to <TT>graduate_cycle</TT>.
<P>
If <TT>remove_from_active_list</TT> returned an exception, the processor
is put into exception mode and will handle the exception as soon as
possible, without decoding or graduating any further instructions in
the meantime.
<P>
<TT>graduate_cycle</TT> also calls <TT>mark_stores_ready</TT>. In this
function, stores are marked ready to send data to the data cache if
they are within the next set of instructions to graduate. Namely, the
store must be no further from the head of the active list than the
processor graduation rate, and all previous instructions must be
completed and guaranteed free of exceptions. The store itself must
also have its address ready and must not cause any exceptions; the
only exception type currently detected at the time of <TT>
mark_stores_ready</TT> is a segmentation fault (other exceptions would
have already been detected). Note that this function considers stores
primarily with regard to their effect on precise exceptions; even
after being marked ready in this fashion, a store may still have to
wait many cycles to issue due to store ordering constraints. In any
system with nonblocking stores (PC, RC, or SC with the ``-N'' option),
a store is considered ready to graduate as soon as it has been marked;
it need not wait for issue or completion in the external memory system.
