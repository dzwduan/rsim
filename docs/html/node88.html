Every cycle, the simulator calls the <TT>
IssueMem</TT> function. In the case of RC, this function first checks if
any outstanding memory fences (<TT>MEMBAR</TT> instructions) can be
broken down - this occurs when every instruction in the class of
operations that the fence has been waiting upon has completed. If the
processor has support for a consistency implementation with speculative load
execution (chosen with ``-K''), all completed speculative loads beyond the voided
fence that are no longer blocked for consistency or disambiguation constraints
are allowed to leave the memory unit through the <TT>PerformMemOp</TT>
function.
<P>
The <TT>IssueMem</TT> function then seeks to allow the issue of actual
loads and stores in the memory system. If the system implements SC or
PC, the <TT>IssueMems</TT> function is called. With RC, <TT>IssueStores</TT>
is called first, followed by <TT>IssueLoads</TT>. We issue instructions
in this order with RC not to favor stores, but rather to favor older
instructions (As discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node75.html#rsimproc_ooo">10</A>, no store can
be marked ready to issue until it is one of the oldest instructions in
the active list and all previous instructions have completed).
<P>
The functions <TT>IssueStores</TT> and <TT>IssueLoads</TT>, or <TT>
IssueMems</TT> for SC and PC systems, scan the appropriate part of the
memory unit for instructions that can be issued this cycle.  At a bare
minimum, the instruction must have passed through address generation
and there must be a cache port available for the instruction. The
following description focuses on the additional requirements for
issuing each type of instruction under each memory consistency model.
Steps 1a-1e below refer to the various types of instructions that may
be considered available for issue. Step&nbsp;2 is required
for each instruction that actually issues.  Step&nbsp;3 is used
only with consistency implementations that include hardware-controlled
non-binding prefetching from the instruction window.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1a: Stores in sequential consistency or processor consistency</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
If the instruction under consideration is a store in SC or PC, it must
be the oldest instruction in the memory unit and must have been
marked ready in the graduate stage (as described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node82.html#rsimproc_ooo_grad">10.7</A>) before it can
issue to the cache.  If the processor supports hardware prefetching
from the instruction window, then the system can mark a store for a
possible hardware prefetch even if it is not ready to issue as a
demand access to the caches.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1b: Stores in release consistency</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Stores in RC issue after being marked ready, if there are no current
ordering constraints imposed by memory fences.  If any such
constraints are present and if the system has hardware prefetching,
the system can mark the store for a possible hardware prefetch.  A
store can be removed from the memory unit as soon as it issues to the
cache, rather than waiting for its completion in the memory
hierarchy (as in sequential consistency
and processor consistency). When a store is issued to the caches,
the processor's <TT>StoresToMem</TT> field is incremented.
However,
as we do not currently simulate data in the caches, stores remain in
what we call a <EM>virtual store buffer</EM>. The virtual store buffer is
part of the <TT>StoreQueue</TT> data structure and has a size equivalent
to the processor's <TT>StoresToMem</TT> field. These elements are not
counted in the memory unit size, but may be used for obtaining values
for later loads.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1c: Loads in sequential consistency</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
A load instruction in sequential consistency can only issue non-speculatively if it is at
the head of the memory unit. If hardware prefetching is enabled, later
marked for possible prefetching. If speculative load execution is
present, later loads can be issued to the caches. Before issuing such
a load, however, the memory unit is checked for any previous stores with
an overlapping address. If a store exactly matches the addresses needed by
the load, the load value can be forwarded directly from the store. However,
if a store address only partially overlaps with the load address, the
load will be stalled in order to guarantee that it reads a correct value
when it issues to the caches.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1d: Loads in processor consistency</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Loads issue in PC under circumstances similar to those of SC. However,
a load can issue non-speculatively whenever it is preceded only by
store operations.  A load that is preceded by store operations must
check previous stores for possible forwarding or stalling before it is
allowed to issue.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 1e: Loads in release consistency</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
In RC, loads can issue non-speculatively whenever they are not
prevented by previous memory barriers<A NAME="tex2html20" HREF="footnode.html#1573"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~vijaypai/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.  As in SC and PC, a load that
is preceded by store operations must check previous stores for
possible forwards or stalls. However, in RC, such checks must also
take place against the virtual store buffer.  As the virtual store
buffer is primarily a simulator abstraction, forwards from this buffer
are used only to learn the final value of the load; the load itself
must issue to the cache as before. However, loads must currently stall
in cases of partial overlaps with instructions in the virtual store
buffer. This constraint is not expected to hinder performance in
applications where most data is either reused (thus keeping data in
cache and giving partial overlaps short latencies) or where most
pointers are strongly typed (making partial overlaps
unlikely). However, if applications do not meet these constraints, it
may be more desirable to simulate the actual data in the caches.
As in the other models, loads hindered by memory consistency model
constraints
can be marked for prefetching or speculatively issued if the consistency
implementation supports such accesses. Although speculative loads
and prefetching are allowed around ordinary <TT>MEMBAR</TT>
instructions, such optimizations are not allowed in the case of
fences with the <TT>MemIssue</TT> field set.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 2: Issuing an instruction to the memory hierarchy</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For both stores and loads, the <TT>IssueOp</TT> function actually
initiates an access. First, the <TT>memprogress</TT> field is set to -1
to indicate that this <TT>instance</TT> is being issued. (In the case of
forwards, the <TT>memprogress</TT> field would have been set to a
negative value). This function then consumes a cache port for the access
(cache ports are denoted as functional units of type <TT>uMEM</TT>).
The <TT>memory_rep</TT> function is then called. This function prepares
the cache port to free again in the next cycle if this access is not
going to be sent to the cache (i.e. if the access is private or if
the processor has issued a <TT>MEMSYS_OFF</TT> directive). Otherwise, the
cache is responsible for freeing the cache port explicitly.
<P>
Next, the <TT>memory_latency</TT> function is called. This function
starts by calling <TT>GetMap</TT>, which checks either the processor <TT>
PageTable</TT> or the shared-memory <TT>SharedPageTable</TT> to determine if
this access is a segmentation fault (alignment errors would have
already been detected by <TT>GetAddr</TT>). If the access has a
segmentation fault or bus error, its cache port is freed up and the
access is considered completed, as the access will not be sent to
cache.
<P>
If the access does not have any of the previous exceptions, it will
now be issued. <TT>PREFETCH</TT> instructions are considered complete and
removed from the memory unit as soon as they are issued. If the
access is an ordinary load or store and is not simulated (i.e. either
a private access or the processor has turned <TT>MEMSYS_OFF</TT>),
it is set to complete in a single cycle. If the access is simulated, it
is sent to the memory hierarchy by calling <TT>StartUpMemRef</TT>.
<P>
<TT>StartUpMemRef</TT> and the other functions in <TT>
src/Processor/memprocess.cc</TT> are responsible for interfacing between the
processor memory unit and the memory hierarchy itself. <TT>
StartUpMemRef</TT> translates the format specified in the <TT>instance</TT>
data structure to a format understood by the cache and memory
simulator. This function then calls the function <TT>addrinsert</TT> to
begin the simulation of an access.
<P>
<TT>addrinsert</TT> starts by initializing a memory system request
data
structure for this memory access. (This data structure type is
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#memsys_req">12.2</A>.) Next, the request is
inserted into its cache port. If this request fills up the cache
ports, then the <TT>L1Q_FULL</TT> field is set to inform the processor
not to issue further requests (this is later cleared by the cache when
it processes a request from its ports).  After this point, the
memory system simulator is responsible for processing this access.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Step 3: Issuing any possible prefetches</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
After the functions that issue instructions have completed, the memory
unit checks to see if any of the possible hardware prefetch
opportunities marked in this cycle can be utilized. If there are cache
ports available, prefetches are issued for those instructions using
<TT>IssuePrefetch</TT>. These prefetches are sent to the appropriate
level of the cache hierarchy, according to the command-line option
used.
