feature are provided in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node77.html#rsimproc_decode">10.2</A>.

should also be dispatched to an issue window; by default, these instructions
are issued directly from the active list. More details about this option

WAW (output) dependences because floating-point registers are mapped and
renamed on double-precision boundaries. This is further discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node75.html#rsimproc_ooo">10</A>

store is globally performed when its value is visible to all processors; i.e.
all other caches with a copy of the line have been invalidated. In RSIM, this is indicated when an acknowledgment for the store is received by the processor.
A load is globally performed when its return value is bound and when the store whose value it returns is globally performed. In RSIM, this is detected when the load returns its value to the processor.

does not yet raise any exception on some unsupported instructions, such as
64-bit integer operations or quadruple-precision
floating-point accesses. It is the user's responsibility to insure that
such instructions are not used. The compiler options we provide in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node16.html#installing_apps">2.4</A> inform the compiler not to generate these
instructions.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="1572">...hierarchy</A><DD>Note that in this chapter, the terms <EM>issue</EM> and <EM>complete</EM> usually refer to issuing to the memory hierarchy and completion at the memory hierarchy. These are different from the issue and completion stages of the processor pipeline.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="1465">...length</A><DD>For some
operations, the minimum alignment requirement specified in the ISA is
smaller than the actual length of data transferred. However, we
simulate a processor that traps and emulates instructions that are not
aligned on a boundary equal to their length, as these seem more
appropriate for high-performance implementation. That is, the
possibility of having multiple cache line accesses and multiple page
faults for a single instruction seems to be an undesirably difficult
problem.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="1573">...barriers</A><DD>Because of the
single-precision floating point problems discussed in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node75.html#rsimproc_ooo">10</A>, single-precision loads do not issue until
their output dependences are resolved. With static scheduling, subsequent
loads will also be prevented from issuing.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="1804">...message</A><DD>In the code, the data structure allocated for
such a message is called the <TT>REQ</TT> data structure. This data
structure is used for requests and reply messages, for both data and
coherence transactions.  We avoid using the term <TT>REQ</TT> in this
manual to avoid any possible confusion with the <TT>REQUEST</TT> message
type.

COHE</TT> request pending on the line. This indicates that no MSHR has
been consumed, but this <TT>REQUEST</TT> must wait for the pending <TT>

</PRE><DT><A NAME="1915">...stall</EM></A><DD>WAR stalls
are not usually seen with straightforward implementations of
consistency models, as stores following loads to the same line
generally depend on the values of those loads. Consequently, such
stores cannot issue in straightforward implementations until the loads
complete.
