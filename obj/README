System-specific compile-time parameters
---------------------------------------

Some UNIX functions take different arguments based on
the specific operating system implementation provided. We
have provided the following preprocessor flags that
can be defined according to the characteristics of the system.

Flag		Description
SIGNAL_4ARGS	Signal handler functions expect four arguments,
		of type int, int, sigcontext *, and char *
SIGNAL_DOTS	Signal handler functions expect a variable number of
		arguments, with the first one being an int
USESIGNAL	"signal" should be used to register a signal handler, rather
		than "sigset"
ONEXIT		The name of the function that registers cleanup
		functions to call before exiting the simulator is "onexit"
		(rather than "atexit")

Using other make utilities instead
----------------------------------

The main difference between the various "make" utilities is the
syntax used for deriving the values of variables from the values of
other variables. For example, gnumake uses the "subst" macro, while
the Sun make utility uses macros based on the "%" symbol.

The differences between the various Makefiles in the subdirectories
is primarily in the way that the OBJS variable is specified. For the
Sun platforms, OBJS is derived from PROC_SRCFILES and MEMSYS_SRCFILES,
whereas OBJS is explicitly specified for the SGI and Convex
platforms. It should be acceptable to explicitly specify the OBJS
variable for any configuration.
